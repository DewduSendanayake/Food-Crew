# 🍔 YummyCrew: Multi-Agent Food Intelligence System

> _Because even AIs get hungry for good architecture._ 🤖🍕


YummyCrew is an experimental **multi-agent system** built with [CrewAI](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI), wrapped in a Flask backend.  
Its mission? **To talk about food, recommend items, and make you smile—while also showing off modern AI coordination.**  

Think of it like a digital restaurant staff:  
- The **Greeter Agent** welcomes you 👋  
- The **Food Recommender Agent** suggests tasty items 🥗🍕  
- The **Retriever Agent** digs up knowledge from S3 📦  
- Flask ties it all together for a clean API 🍽️  



## 🎯 Features  
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: CrewAI agents working together in harmony  
- **Vector Search**: Food knowledge stored & retrieved from Amazon S3  
- **Conversational Interface**: Agents can greet, recommend, and explain  
- **API Ready**: Easily tested with Postman or integrated into a UI  


## 📚 Academic Angle

This project demonstrates,

- Multi-Agent Coordination → Distributed intelligence via CrewAI
- Vector Retrieval → Semantic food knowledge base
- API Abstraction → Wrapping LLM orchestration in Flask for real-world use

It’s basically a mini research playground where AI theory meets tasty practice.
